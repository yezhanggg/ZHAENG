# ZHAENG Camera Feature

## Overview
A mobile-first camera web application that allows users to take photos with custom ZHAENG watermarks, timestamps, and location data. Optimized for iPhone and mobile devices.

## Features

### Photo Capture
- Access front and rear cameras on mobile devices
- Full-screen camera preview
- Large, touch-friendly capture button
- Camera flip functionality

### Watermark System
- **Border Pattern**: "ZHAENG" text repeated around all four edges of the photo
- **Center Watermark**: Large, semi-transparent "ZHAENG" logo in the center
- **Professional Design**: Semi-transparent overlays that don't overwhelm the photo

### Metadata Overlay
- **Timestamp**: Displays the exact date and time the photo was taken
- **Location**: Shows GPS coordinates (latitude and longitude) when available
- **Format**: Clean, readable overlay at the bottom of the photo

### Save Functionality
- Download photos directly to your iPhone/device
- Photos saved as high-quality JPEG
- Filename includes "ZHAENG" prefix and timestamp

## How It Works

### 1. Permission Request
- App requests camera access
- App requests location access (optional, but adds location data to photos)

### 2. Camera Interface
- Video preview fills the screen
- Capture button at bottom center
- Flip camera button to switch between front/back cameras

### 3. Photo Capture
- Tap the large white capture button
- Photo is processed with watermarks and metadata
- Preview screen shows the final result

### 4. Save or Retake
- **Save Photo**: Downloads to your device
- **Retake**: Returns to camera to take another photo

## Technical Details

### Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structure and canvas for image manipulation
- **CSS3**: Mobile-first responsive design
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No dependencies, fast loading
- **MediaDevices API**: Camera access
- **Geolocation API**: Location tracking
- **Canvas API**: Image processing and watermarking

### Mobile Optimizations
- `viewport` meta tag prevents zooming

- Gesture prevention for iOS
- Apple-specific meta tags for web app mode

### Browser Compatibility

## Customization

- Change `#4A90E2` to your brand color

### Text
- Change "ZHAENG" to any text you want in the watermark
- Header text is in the HTML: `<div id="header">ZHAENG</div>`

## Privacy & Permissions

### What Data is Collected?
- **Camera**: Photos are processed locally, never uploaded
- **Location**: GPS coordinates are added to photos if permission granted
- **Storage**: Photos are saved only to the user's device

### Security
- All processing happens client-side (in the browser)
- No data sent to external servers
- No analytics or tracking

## Troubleshooting

- Check browser permissions
- Ensure you're using HTTPS (not HTTP)
- Try refreshing the page
- Check if another app is using the camera

### Location Not Showing
- Enable location services in device settings
- Grant permission when prompted
- Location may take a few seconds to acquire

### Photos Not Saving
