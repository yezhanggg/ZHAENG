## Tips & Tricks

### For Best Results

**Portrait Photos**:
- Use 1000-2000 pieces for maximum scrambling
- Faces become unrecognizable but colors remain

**Landscapes**:
- 500-1000 pieces preserve some recognizability
- Sky and terrain create interesting patterns

**Text/Documents**:
- Higher piece counts (2000+) completely obscure text
- Great for privacy while keeping document aesthetics

**Abstract Images**:
- Any piece count works
- Creates layered abstract effects

### Performance Tips

- **Large images**: May take a moment to process
- **High piece counts**: Custom grids above 100×100 may be slow
- **Mobile devices**: Stick to 500-1000 pieces for best performance

### Artistic Techniques

1. **Subtle Scramble**: Use 500 pieces, keep grid visible
2. **Complete Chaos**: Use 2000+ pieces, scramble multiple times
3. **Controlled Randomness**: Custom grid with specific ratios
4. **Mosaic Effect**: Enable grid overlay, use 1000 pieces

## Understanding the Stats

### Total Pieces
Shows how many individual tiles your image is divided into.

### Grid
Displays the grid dimensions (columns × rows).
Example: "40×25" means 40 columns and 25 rows.

### Piece Size
Shows the pixel dimensions of each individual tile.
Larger images = larger tiles at same grid size.

### Status
Current operation:
- "Ready" - Image loaded, ready to scramble
- "Scrambled" - Tiles have been shuffled
- "Reset to original" - Back to original arrangement
